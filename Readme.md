# Breast Cancer Subtype Classification - TCGA-BRCA

This project explores the use of machine learning for the classification of breast cancer subtypes using clinical and genomic data from the TCGA-BRCA project. Our objective is to automate the diagnosis and classification of subtypes such as Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched, and Triple-Negative, supporting improved treatment planning and diagnostic consistency.

## üîç Project Overview

Breast cancer is highly heterogeneous and subtype classification is crucial for effective treatment. We utilize data from the Genomic Data Commons (GDC), particularly clinical data associated with the TCGA-BRCA cohort, to train models.

Key components:
- Raw data: `data.json` (clinical data from GDC)
- Filtered data: `filtered_data.csv` (subset for model training)

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions
